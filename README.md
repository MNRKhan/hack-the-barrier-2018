# Maple Chat: hack-the-barrier-2018
MapleChat is a website intended to help young immigrants integrate with Canadian communities by allowing them to connect with post-immigrants. The website allows users to join chatrooms based on their interests to meet new people in their community. Each room can have upto 100 users. The frontend of the website has been implemented using ReactJS and the backend using the ChatKit API.
The website could be extended to feature a forum page that allows for Q&A sessions.

In order to view the site, run the following commands from a cloned directory:
##### `cd youthwelcome`
##### `npm install`
##### `npm start`
